                                <p>At G.D. Goenka Public School, Bareilly, we follow a holistic, inclusive, and
                                    forward-thinking curriculum that aligns with the standards set by the Central Board
                                    of Secondary Education (CBSE), National Council of Educational Research and Training
                                    (NCERT), and the guidelines of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Our
                                    curriculum is designed to provide a seamless and enriching learning experience from
                                    Nursery to Grade 12, ensuring students develop academically, emotionally, socially,
                                    and ethically.</p>
                                <p>
                                <h3>CBSE and NCERT Curriculum</h3>
                                We follow the CBSE curriculum, a national-level board that ensures a robust academic
                                structure emphasizing analytical thinking, problem-solving, and real-world
                                applications. The CBSE curriculum is enriched by NCERT textbooks, which are renowned
                                for their conceptual clarity and comprehensive approach to subjects across various
                                grades. This combination ensures that our students receive a standardized education
                                that is recognized both nationally and internationally.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    From foundational learning in Nursery and Early Years Education, focusing on
                                    play-based and experiential learning, to the more structured academics in Grade 1 to
                                    12, we emphasize critical thinking, creativity, and inquiry-based learning. Our
                                    curriculum is crafted to help students grasp core concepts in subjects like
                                    Mathematics, Science, Social Science, and Languages while also encouraging
                                    exploration and innovation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <h3>National Education Policy (NEP) Alignment</h3>
                                The introduction of the NEP 2020 has redefined the future of Indian education, and
                                at G.D. Goenka Public School, we have embraced this transformative policy. The NEP
                                focuses on reducing rote learning and promoting critical thinking, creativity, and
                                interdisciplinary approaches. Our curriculum integrates these reforms, allowing
                                flexibility in subjects, fostering a deeper understanding, and promoting skill
                                development from an early age. We emphasize foundational literacy and numeracy,
                                vocational education, and life skills to prepare students for the challenges of the
                                modern world.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Lead Curriculum School</h3>
                                As a Lead Curriculum School, we go beyond traditional methods of teaching. The Lead
                                Curriculum is an innovative approach designed to make learning more interactive,
                                engaging, and personalized. It integrates digital tools, modern pedagogical
                                techniques, and real-world contexts to make lessons more relevant to students.
                                Through the Lead Curriculum, our students benefit from world-class resources,
                                continuous assessments, and individualized learning pathways that cater to their
                                unique learning styles. This ensures that every student progresses at their own pace
                                while achieving excellence in academics.
                                </p>
                                <p>At G.D. Goenka Public School, we are committed to developing well-rounded
                                    individuals who not only excel in their studies but also possess the values and life
                                    skills necessary to make a positive impact on the world.
