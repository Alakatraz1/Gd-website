                    <p>
                        At GD Goenka Public School, Bareilly, we believe in nurturing not only academic excellence but
                        also leadership and life skills in our students. It brings us immense pride and joy to share a
                        remarkable achievement by one of our brightest students, Gauri Sri Vastav from Class VIII. She
                        recently represented our school at the prestigious international conference, â€˜Embracing
                        Artificial Intelligence for Sustainability and Life Skills,â€™ held in Paro, Bhutan, on the 24th
                        and 25th of August 2024.

                    <p>
                        Gauriâ€™s participation in this global event was nothing short of exceptional. As a volunteer, she
                        not only attended the conference but played a crucial role behind the scenes. Gauri coordinated
                        seamlessly with Indian and international delegates, working alongside the conference team to
                        ensure everything ran smoothly. She assisted in preparing certificates and meticulously worked
                        on the itinerary, showcasing her organizational skills and attention to detail.

                    <p>
                        The conference, which focused on the intersection of artificial intelligence, sustainability,
                        and life skills, brought together experts and thought leaders from around the world. Gauri had
                        the unique opportunity to interact with these global experts, gaining insights and learning
                        about the role of AI in shaping a sustainable future. Her experience at the conference has
                        broadened her understanding of AI, technology, and global challenges, a knowledge that will no
                        doubt inspire her peers and contribute to our schoolâ€™s growing legacy.
