                                <strong>Message From CIO</strong>

                                <p>In today’s world, technology is more than a tool—it is an enabler of limitless
                                    possibilities. As the Chief Information Officer of G.D. Goenka Public School, my
                                    role is to ensure that our students have access to the best technological
                                    resources that prepare them for the dynamic future ahead.</p>
                                <p>
                                    In alignment with our Chairman’s vision of shaping independent, imaginative, and
                                    compassionate leaders, and our CEO’s focus on innovation and growth, my
                                    objective is to integrate cutting-edge technology into every aspect of our
                                    students' learning experience. Technology is a bridge that connects knowledge
                                    with application, and at G.D. Goenka Bareilly, we are committed to building that bridge with a
                                    solid foundation in values and purpose.</p>
                                <p>
                                    We live in an age where information is readily available, but what matters most
                                    is how we harness it. By infusing our core values of Integrity, Excellence,
                                    Heritage, and Compassion into our technological advancements, we are not only
                                    teaching our students how to use technology but also guiding them on how to use
                                    it responsibly and ethically.</p>
                                <p>
                                    As someone with experience in the global IT industry, I bring a perspective that
                                    combines international standards with a deep respect for our local context. My
                                    mission is to provide our students with a learning environment where they can
                                    confidently explore digital tools, develop critical thinking skills, and become
                                    innovators who will contribute to society.</p>
                                <p>
                                    At G.D. Goenka Public School, we see technology not just as a subject to be
                                    learned, but as a transformative force that can enhance creativity,
                                    collaboration, and critical thinking. Together, with the support of our
                                    management team, we are building a future-ready institution where students are
                                    equipped to thrive in a technology-driven world while staying true to their
                                    values.
